### Introduction
This data analysis project explores COVID-19 cases and deaths recorded globally from 2019 to 2021. 
By analyzing trends in infections, fatalities, and regional impacts, we aim to identify the countries and regions most affected by the pandemic. 
This project provides valuable insights into the spread of the virus, mortality rates, and other key patterns, offering a deeper understanding of the global impact of COVID-19.

_***Disclaimer***_: All datasets and reports do not represent any company, institution or country, but just a dummy dataset to demonstrate my data analysis capabilities.

### Problem Statment
The analysis will focus on:

1. Global Statistics – Total COVID-19 cases, total deaths, and overall infection and mortality percentages.
2. Continental Trends – Identifying the continents with the highest and lowest infection rates.
3. Most Affected Countries – Highlighting the countries with the highest number of recorded infections.
4. Population Impact & Forecasting – Examining the percentage of the population infected and predicting potential trends if vaccines had not been developed.
